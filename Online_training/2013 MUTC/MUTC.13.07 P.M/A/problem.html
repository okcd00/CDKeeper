<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The great Mr.Smith has invented a hyperspace particle generator. The device is very powerful. The device can generate a hyperspace. In the hyperspace, particle may appear and disappear randomly. At the same time a great amount of energy.</p>
<p>However, the device is in test phase, often in a unstable state. Mr.Smith worried that it may cause an explosion when testing it. The energy of the device is related to the maximum manhattan distance between particle.</p>
<p>Particle may appear and disappear any time. Mr.Smith wants to know the maxmium manhattan distance between particle when particle appears or disappears.</p>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>The input contains several test cases, terminated by EOF.</p>
<p>In each case: In the first line, there are two integer <span class="math"><em>q</em></span>(number of particle appear and disappear event) and <span class="math"><em>k</em></span>(dimensions of the hyperspace that the hyperspace the device generated). Then follows <span class="math"><em>q</em></span> lines. In each line, the first integer '<span class="math"><em>o</em><em>d</em></span>' represents the event: <span class="math"><em>o</em><em>d</em> = 0</span> means this is an appear event. Then follows <span class="math"><em>k</em></span> integer(with absolute value less then <span class="math">4 × 10<sup>7</sup></span>). <span class="math"><em>o</em><em>d</em> = 1</span> means this is an disappear event. Follows a integer <span class="math"><em>p</em></span> represents the disappeared particle appeared in the pth event.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Each test case should contains <code>q</code> lines. Each line contains a integer represents the maximum manhattan distance between particle.</p>
